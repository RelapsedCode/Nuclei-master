# Project overview
Nuclei is made so the user can easily select color values, apply simple morphological operations and output the number of pixels and the percentage, of the selected colors. It is used to calculate the percentage of healthy and/or cells. It bundles the most frequently used OpenCV functions for image processing.

# How to use it
Simple first time run combination: N-Q-M-W\
Place the desired image in "..\nuclei\images\source-img.jpg". The image has to be in jpg format.
* K | convert RGB color to HSV colorspace
* N |- load example color values 1
* M |- load example color values 1
* Q | save the image as image 1
* W | save the image as image 2
* ESC | close the application
